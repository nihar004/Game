This project is a simple timer challenge game built with React. It allows users to start a timer and attempt to stop it before time runs out. The project includes a `TimerChallenge` component that handles the game logic and displays the results in a modal once the time expires.

## Features

- **Timer Start/Stop:** Users can start and stop the timer.
- **Result Modal:** Displays a modal with the result (win/lose) when the timer expires.
- **Customizable Timer:** The timer duration can be set via props.
